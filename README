CIOSUP is a quick and dirty script to apply a basic configuration to
a newly unboxed Cisco switch using the serial console.

Create a YAML based configuration file containing the required
commands to be sent to the switch and use the 'ciosup' command
to push it all to the switch.

CIOSUP requires the following Python modules:

pexpect>= 2.4
PyYAML>=3.10
pyserial>=2.6

It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.8 system with a Prolific-based
USB to serial adapter.  You will need to make sure the file 
permissions of the /dev file for your serial device allow you to
read and write to the serial device.

Note that this script does not do any validation of the YAML file.
If you mess up the formatting you will see Python exceptions
involving dictionary key errors.
